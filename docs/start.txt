Welcome to CloudButler! 
This chatbot was designed to be extremely easy to use and flexible to your use case. We recommend you start up a private chat with the bot and use these commands to get set up.
1. `help operable`: This will explain the large majority of the chatbot's features.
2. `owner-add`: This will get you set up as an admin on the bot so that you can start making changes.
3. `user-list`: Use this to get informed on the users already using the bot.
4. `help helper`: Get a list of other commands you might want to use to get started.

This platform is based on the Cog platform, orginally created by Operable.
